# Debugging
* **running WINE from a build dir**: it will provide a `./wine â†’ tools/winewrapper` symlink that is a shell-script wrapper setting up the necessary env. variables and running wine. If you really want, you may do that manually with a `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=libs/wine WINELOADER=loader/wine loader/wine /tmp/my.exe`
* **loading WINE's debugging symbols**: note, this is not about `winedbg --gdb`, this is about running in `gdb` wine itself. `source` [this script](https://github.com/rbernon/wine/blob/develop/tools/gdbinit.py), and then, once you stopped at breakpoint, execute a `load-symbol-files`/`lsf`. As of writing the words, this command needs to be executed every time a module gets loaded, it won't do that automatically.
