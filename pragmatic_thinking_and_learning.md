# New cues

* trying to write thoughts 1-st thing in the morning.
* going for a walk may help solving the problem — but gotta avoid focusing on the problem *(the L-mode)*, instead just bear it in mind.
* turn the thing on its head. Instead of fixing try to find way to break — that will show what to fix.
* `learning` may be improved by using mind-maps. Actually, it indeed may be useful in terms of: create an observatory mind-map, and then create new points and connections as you go. It will allow to find some connections that you would miss otherwise *(that's basically experimentation and play)*.
* imagining success *(or creating environment where winning is easy)* improves performance during the actual work.
