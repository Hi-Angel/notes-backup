# Agile Sw Development

Reportedly, better than "waterfall" and some other techniques. Benefits: 1. fast time-to-market/devel cycle, 2. Adaptability to external requirements changes.

## Scrum

* work is broken into goals to be completed within a "sprint". A sprint lasts no more than a month, typically 2 weeks.
* "sprint" starts with a planning up to 8 hours. It doesn't have to be a all-team meeting *(contrary to how it's done sometimes)*.
* daily stand-ups aka "daily scrums" are used to assess the current progress. They shouldn't last longer than 15 minutes.

  The "15 minutes" deadline seems hard to meet in practice, but one reason may be that stand ups are not supposed to be a meeting to discuss problems, but only to point them out. However, apparently there may be time "after the meeting" to discuss some technical problems, so called "after-party", which doesn't count as part of "stand-up".
* 2 meetings at the end of sprint: 1. demo for stakeholders and 2. sprint retrospective.
* **Product backlog**: a list of features, bug fixes and non-functional requirements.
* **Sprint backlog**: a list of sprint tasks taken from "product backlog".

## Gotchas

* focus on development may lead to lack of documentation, which then due to key engineers leaving may result in decreased productivity.
