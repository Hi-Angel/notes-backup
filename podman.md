Has same CLI as Docker, but is better in terms of security *(easier audit, and there's also no services running as root)*, and no need to run a service for it to work. It is completely compatible with Docker.

Due to its similarity to `docker`, most of the stuff mentioned in `docker.md` applied to `podman` as well, so I see no need to copy it here.

# Setting up

The two `/etc/sub{u,g}id` files need to have a line like `constantine:165536:65536`. The 2nd column seems to be arbitrary, but tutorials prefer for it to start at least with 100k. For 3rd column, a 2ยนโถ is usually recommended.

# Examples

* Run `ubuntu:18.04` with the directory `foo` mounted inside the container
    ```
    podman run --rm -v ~/Projects/foo:/home/user/Projects/foo -it ubuntu:18.04
    ```
* Commit currently running `foo` as `foo`
    ```
    podman commit $(podman ps | perl -lane 'print @F[-1] if /foo/') foo
    ```
