Has same CLI as Docker, but is better in terms of security *(easier audit, and there's also no services running as root)*, and no need to run a service for it to work. It is completely compatible with Docker.

Due to its similarity to `docker`, most of the stuff mentioned in `docker.md` applied to `podman` as well, so I see no need to copy it here.

# Initial setup

1. Create a `/etc/subgid` and `/etc/subuid` files with the following line *(substitute username with your user name)*: `username:100000:65536`. The 2nd column seems to be arbitrary, but tutorials prefer for it to start at least with 100k. For 3rd column, a 2ยนโถ is usually recommended.
2. Run `podman system migrate`
3. Create a `~/.config/containers/containers.conf` file *(to avoid problems with readline hotkey C-p)* with
    ```
    [engine]
    detach_keys=""
    ```


# Examples

* Run `ubuntu:18.04` with the directory `foo` mounted inside the container
    ```
    podman run --rm -v ~/Projects/foo:/home/user/Projects/foo -it ubuntu:18.04
    ```
* Commit currently running `foo` as `foo`
    ```
    podman commit $(podman ps | perl -lane 'print @F[-1] if /foo/') foo
    ```
