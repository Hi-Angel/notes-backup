# Example of creating a package from a `make install`

**Note:** this one is mostly generated by ChatGPT, but I didn't check the correctness, saved just in case, for future use. Here we basically have compiled sources and run a `make install` to install them inside the gonna-be flatpak package.

A `manifest.yml` file that specifies package dependencies and build instructions.

```
app-id: org.example.myapp
runtime: org.gnome.Platform
runtime-version: 3.38
sdk: org.gnome.Sdk
command: myapp
build-options:
  install-commands:
  - make install
modules:
- name: myapp
  buildsystem: simple
  sources:
  # specifies the files that flatpak will be built from. May be omitted if the `build-options`
  # refers to a prebuilt directory or archive through `install-dir` option. In this case
  # `install-commands` should be omitted as well.
  - type: dir
    path: .
```

Then to build the flatpak package:

    flatpak-builder /destination/directory /path/to/manifest
