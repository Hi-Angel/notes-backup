As I forget every time what works and what not, here.

# simplescreenrecorder

Supports quite a few formats, has quite a few options. Works for me. Has a tray icon, so you can start/pause/continue recording by clicking it.

I haven't used it for long recording sessions, but for short ones works well.

## Gotchas

It has good docs on various errors. Ones I stumbled upon:

* make sure to use a codec that is supported by video container *(it says in a codec description when it's not supported)*. I think codecs that are not supported by a container should be grayed out, Idk why they aren't.
